## Assignment 2
### Flow Field

In this assignment I had to work with flow fields to move or control an object or a vehicle's path.
From the list of options of flow fields, I chose to make a flow field of vectors that point to the middle of the screen.


Here is how it works:

I did not find any difficulties with this assignment to be honest. It was easy to make this type of field.

I tried to make a field that follows the mouse, but I could not figure that out. :(


Thank you :)
