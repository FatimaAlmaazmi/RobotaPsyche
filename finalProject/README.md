## Final Project

**General**
Create an association towards sad vehicles. A sad vehicle would behave in a way that is odd or off, maybe it would quiver? or move slowly, or at a different pace than the rest of the vehicles. And, then the 'happy' or normal vehicles, would notice this and approach the sad vehicle, and give it some of their happiness. Then the sad vehicle turns normal and moves like everyone else. So, whenever the normal vehicles would see a sad vehicle they would approach it to help it. 


**Specific**
I've been reading a lot about orcas, from how they interact in the wild, to how they interact in captivity. And, one thing that I noticed is their sense of community? So, I will try to implement that with my idea.


Orcas in captivity, are nearly always suffering mentally and physically. And, sometimes this can be seen through their fins. Wild Orcas rarely have dorsal fins, and thats because they swim in wide areas with no ristrictions at all, and their fins enhance their hydrodynamics. In contrast, captive whales, who spend their lives in small tanks, and swim only in circular motions, are more likely to have dorsal fins. 



Even though, having a dorsal fin is not a direct association to sad orcas, but I beleive that all captive orcas are sad orcas.



So, in my code. Orcas with dorsal fins, are more likely to be sad. And they would swim differently from the other orcas. And, 'normal' orcas would swim in pods, and they will notice the sad orca, and approach it and help it, by making it part of their pod :)
