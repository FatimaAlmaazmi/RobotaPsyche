## Final Project

**General**
Create an association towards sad vehicles. A sad vehicle would behave in a way that is odd or off, maybe it would quiver? or move slowly, or at a different pace than the rest of the vehicles. And, then the 'happy' or normal vehicles, would notice this and approach the sad vehicle, and give it some of their happiness. Then the sad vehicle turns normal and moves like everyone else. So, whenever the normal vehicles would see a sad vehicle they would approach it to help it. 


**Specific**
I've been reading a lot about orcas, from how they interact in the wild, to how they interact in captivity. And, one thing that I noticed is their sense of community? So, I will try to implement that with my idea.


Orcas in captivity, are nearly always suffering mentally and physically. And, sometimes this can be seen through their fins. Wild Orcas rarely have dorsal fins, and thats because they swim in wide areas with no ristrictions at all, and their fins enhance their hydrodynamics. In contrast, captive whales, who spend their lives in small tanks, and swim only in circular motions, are more likely to have dorsal fins. 



Even though, having a dorsal fin is not a direct association to sad orcas, but I beleive that all captive orcas are sad orcas.



So, in my code. Orcas with dorsal fins, are more likely to be sad. And they would swim differently from the other orcas. And, 'normal' orcas would swim in pods, and they will notice the sad orca, and approach it and help it, by making it part of their pod :)

### DAY1 19th April 2020

**Plan:**

recap on flocking code, and association code.

For now, my plan is to get my code to work, then I will work on how it looks :)



This is how I want the code to look like in the end:

![](https://github.com/FatimaAlmaazmi/RobotaPsyche/blob/main/pics/CamScanner%2004-19-2021%2011.50_1.jpg)

I want to have a flock or pod of orcas that swim around. When the mouse is clicked a random Orca (either sad/dorsal normal/dorsal sad/normal) to appear from the right. Then it will all depend on the type of Orca. If it is a normal orca, it will join the pod on its own. If it is a sad orca, it will swim around aimlessly alone, until the orca pod spots it and notices it and then approaches it to help it by making it part of their pod. Therefore, the number of orcas in a pod will keep increasing.


**What I did:**

On this day, I started working on my code. I copied the different types of codes that I will be needing for my code, like the association, flock, and seek codes. I changed them so that they fit the context of my code. But, I am confused as to why the association code did not work. I will work on it tomorrow.


-------------------------------

### DAY2 20th April 2021

**Plan:**

Since I took some time off, work on the code again and see what happens.


**What I did:**

I worked on my code today, and applied a few changes. First, I realized that I applied all of the concepts at once and did not check if they worked separately. Therefore, I worked on getting the flocking functions to work. I applied a few changes, and it worked nicely. Then I realized that they always leave the screen, and I wanted to find a way to keep them in. In 6th chapter of the Nature of Code, I found a function that does exactly this, so I applied it. It worked quite nicely.

The thing that I noticed today is that I was applying the association function in the wrong way. The professor constructed it in term of avoiding, and I have to construct it in terms of seeking. So, I'll have to find a way to do that, but I'm not sure.

I am also contemplating whether I should add a DNA class or not. I'm not sure.

-------------------------------------

### DAY3 21st April 2021

**Plan:**

work on code :)


**What I did:**

I did not get the chance to work on my code today, but I did schedule a meeting with the professor so we could work it out together :)

-----------------------------------------

### DAY4 24th April 2021

**Plan:**

Look over a few things and see what you missed. +
Try to draw the orcas.


**What I did:**

I did not realize this before, but I think that drawing the orcas will be pretty hard. I have some type of phobia, I am really scared of looking at pictures of orcas. I have nightmares about them sometimes, and they really scare me. But, at the same time, I love them and I care for them. They've been through so much in captivity, and I love this concept. I'll try my best to draw them without looking at references, so I might end up with weird creatures at the end of this project lol.


I tried drawing them... Here are the results:


![Dorsal Orca](https://github.com/FatimaAlmaazmi/RobotaPsyche/blob/main/pics/dorsalOrca.png)

![Normal Orca](https://github.com/FatimaAlmaazmi/RobotaPsyche/blob/main/pics/normalOrca.png)



In terms of code, I'm looking forward to working on it with the professor today, so yup :)


I worked on the code after the meeting. The professor cleared a lot of things for me. I feel more confident with my code now, but I need a bit more time to work on it to see why I am stuck. Inshallah I will work on it tomorrow night because I'm feeling quite tired.
