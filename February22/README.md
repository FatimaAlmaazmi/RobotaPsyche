## Assignment 3
### DNA

For this assignment I had to apply a set of behaviors with return instead of applyForce, and I had to create a DNA for each vehicle.


Returning the behaviors was simple.

Creating DNA was confusing.

I understand the concept, I don't know exactly how to apply it. I have created a DNA class with a set of variable that would distinguish each vehicle. I added characteristics like mass, speed, force, and color. And I initialized them in the constructor of the DNA class with random values.

The professor mentions in his notes that I create a function in the intial Vehicle class that would return the DNA. I am not sure exactly what that entails, because I am a bit confused about the concept of return. But, I came up with this function:

I am not sure if that is what I am supposed to do. I even added the DNA object as an argument in the class Vehicle's constructor as so:


Vehicle(PVector v, **DNA d**){


}


I am still unsure how I will add a unique DNA to each vehicle. I hope that I will get a clearer image of that in class tomorrow :)


Thank you :)
