## Final Project Idea


For my final project, I am going to make a program that uses association.


One idea that I want to try, is to create an association towards sad vehicles (I might call them something else later). A sad vehicle would behave in a way that is odd or off, maybe it would quiver? or move slowly, or at a different pace than the rest of the vehicles. And, then the 'happy' or normal vehicles, would notice this and approach the sad vehicle, and give it some of their happiness. Then the sad vehicle turns normal and moves like everyone else. So, whenever the normal vehicles would see a sad vehicle they would approach it to help it. 


I am also thinking of making a double association like we did in class (agressive and red), I'm not sure....

I'm still unsure of my idea, I want to figure out a scenario to build this upon but I'm still thinking about it :)
