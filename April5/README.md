## Vector Projection

For this assignment, I had to make a static program that displays a vector projection. I understood the math behind it, but I am still unsure how that is reflected in the code. I'm not sure if I was supposed to draw everything, but I did to make sure and I encountered some problems that I did not find the time to solve :(

The problem was the way the vector V and VM were drawn. I tried to recreate the diagram that the Professor drew in class in my program, by drawing circles to indicate each point (p1, p2, p3). I also drew lines to represent the vectors V and VM, but for some reason they are drawn in the opposite direction? I'm not sure what went wrong there, I switched the pairings in the .sub function thinking that I might have paired the points wrong, but it became worse after I did that. The only thing I'm suspecting at this point is the line() function. I've never used the line() function before, and I have never liked it. It's always confusing and it never draws the lines that I wanted. Therefore, I feel that maybe my problem lies there. However, I am still unsure :(

## Discussion points on reading:

so far this has been my favorite reading. I loved that each chapter had a different story about robots, and how much of an affect they have on the humans that interact with it. It created this utopian world, where I felt that I wanted to be a part of it. 


1. Gloria's story with her "nursemaid" robot Robbie, brought up a lot of discussion points that we have already discussed in class about robots and consciousness and how robots could potentially be a part of our lives. Therefore, **I guess my first point of discussion would be about the possibility of such a thing, and the positives of it.** We've been focusing a lot on the negatives of what is to come with robots, I'm curious about the positives and the possibilities because I really want to live in this utopian world where humans and robots coexist.
2. Another point that Robbie's story brings up is how robots could potentially take over other jobs, but is it for the better? I guess in Robbie's case, he took over the job of the nursemaid, and in my eyes he seemed more reliable than a human nanny. In my society, a lot of families depend on nannies to take care of their children when they are away, and there have been so many cases of child abuse that come forward as a result. Therefore, a robot whose sole purpose is to take care of a child, and who is constructed to follow laws that prohibits them from casuing harm to a human, seems more reliable to me in this case. Therefore, the second point of discussion would be about **how robots in some cases can be more reliable than humans.**
3. This dicussion about jobs and robots brings the discussion of the ethics of robot labor, and when does it turn into slavery? This was also elluded in the chapter Runaround, where the antique robots were programmed in a way that viewed humans as masters, and them as slaves or servants. 
4. The stories are based around robots that have human-like understanding and feelings, like empathy, relationships, needs, wants, and even feeling sad. And, in these stories, in some cases, these robots were treated as objects that serve. Unless they had a deeper connection with the robot like Gloria and Robbie. Therefore, even if robots display human-like mannerisms, would we still treat them as objects? or slaves/servants?
5. Its 3am right now, and I'm trying really hard to look for a final point. I am very sorry I cannot come up with a final one :( I hope that these four will suffice.




Thank you :)
