##Discussion Points on Reading:

 I was so amazed by the concept of this chapter. I never really thought about other consequences that could arise if robots developed reason. So here are a few questions I have after reading it.

1. If robots develop this sense of reason, and begin to rationalize things around them like we would. Should they be treated as another race that is a part of our society? Will we respect their reasonings and decisions? Or try to change it like Donovan and Powell?
2. Is a robot with reason something that we really want? The main purpose of robots overall is to help and aid us. So, if they perform well in that aspect, do we have to allow them to have a sense of reason? Because, in the chapter we can see how Powell and Donavan's intial reaction was to stop the robot from reasoning.
3. Another question that this brings up is one that is also suggested in the star trek episode we watched. So, if we have this group of robot, who have their own way of living, their own religion, their own community. In a sense they become a whole new race, so would using them for labor be another form of slavery?
